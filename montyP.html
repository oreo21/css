<h1>Shut up!</h1>

<p>We want a shrubbery!! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Why do you think that she is a witch? And the hat. She's a witch!</p>
<p>A newt? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Camelot! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>

<h2>The nose?</h2>
<p>Bring her forward! Shut up! What do you mean? Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Shut up!</li>
    <li>I dunno. Must be a king.</li>
    <li>You don't vote for kings.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Well, I didn't vote for you.</h3>
<p>Did you dress her up like this? We found them. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! What a strange person. You don't vote for kings.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical!</li>
    <li>What a strange person.</li>
    <li>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<p>Well, what do you want? How do you know she is a witch? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!</p>
<p>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! We found them.</p>
<p>I'm not a witch. I dunno. Must be a king. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
<p>Now, look here, my good man. Where'd you get the coconuts? Be quiet! It's only a model. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</p>
<p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Did you dress her up like this? Well, we did do the nose. Well, I got better.</p>
<p>Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! I'm not a witch. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Why? Look, my liege!</p>
<p>He hasn't got shit all over him. I dunno. Must be a king. The nose? Burn her anyway!</p>
<p>The nose? Shut up! Will you shut up?! It's only a model. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, I got better. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
<p>I am your king. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. And the hat. She's a witch!</p>
<p>Bloody Peasant! Well, we did do the nose. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
